# HTTP from TCP in Haskell

Trying to follow boot.dev's [HTTP protocol course](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-http-protocol-golang) using Haskell instead of Go, starting with step 2. The goal of this project is to familiarize myself with monadic code, specifically those dealing with side effects using the IO monad.
Some parts of the course that uses Go specific features such as channels are skipped, for now. Maybe I'll try emulate them as an exercise later.
